# Chains in LangChain are a way to link together multiple components (like prompts, models, and tools)

# to create more complex workflows. They allow you to pass the output of one component as the input to another,
# enabling you to build sophisticated applications with ease.

# They are of various types, including
# 1. Simple Chains,
# 2. Sequential Chains,
# 3. Complex ones like Router Chains.
# Parallel Chains,
