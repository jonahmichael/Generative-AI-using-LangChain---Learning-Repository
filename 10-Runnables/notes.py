# In 2022, when LLM models started to gain popularity,
# there were many companies that offered API access to their models.
# Some of the notable companies included OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic.

# But each of these companies had different ways of structuring their API calls,
# different authentication methods, and different response formats.

# Therefore, they wanted build a framework that would allow them to easily switch between different LLM providers
# without having to rewrite their entire codebase each time they wanted to use a different model.
